# SNAKE
arcade game
Basic arcade game with some features like:
  Bestscore display (holds max 10 highest scores)
  lifes - defoult=3, easly changable in the code
  Map choice - right now only 2 maps are implemented but more can be added. Map is basicly a matrix of zeros and ones (one=wall, zero=no wall)


game itself runs on Pygame

to run this game you have to download the folder and change variable "folder" to match your directory.

As this was my 1st semester project, you can find code somewhat messy or chaotic.
